                <p>
                    I am a first year student at the ^University^, currently studying for my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. Computers have fascinated me from an early age, and I doubt said fascination will ever stop. This makes me confident in the fact that the title of student is a permanent one for me.

            <li class="skill webdev">
                <h2>Web Developer</h2>
                <p>
                    I am fluent at HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Bootstrap as well as Git(Hub), Electron and NodeJS. I started learning web dev at the age of 16, and have kept up my passion for designing websites with minimalism at the forefront. I design websites with easy-to-use and straightforward user interfaces.

                <h2>Programmer</h2>
                <p>
                    Being a Computer Science student, of course I'm a programmer. I often write snippets of code that I believe can smoothen my computing experience. I'm experienced at Python, JavaScript, Markdown and Git.

                <p>
                    Experimenting with GIMP in the 9th grade helped me grow my love for digital art. Combining that with my passion for photography made me start my Instagram page where I upload my work.
